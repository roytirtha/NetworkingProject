# A Simple P2P Chat Application
This is a peer to peer chat application.
It is highly recommendable beacuse it is safe to send messages...Nobody can see the messages except the sender and receiver.

Here we use the concept of peer to peer to build this application.
There is no central server in this app.We use socket programming to implement this app. Here we use port number 
and Ip address to send a message to a device..First the two user must use the same network in order to send message or receive message.
Initially when the app is started it will show a splash screen..Then two options are provided for users.One is IpAddress and the other is
Wifi...Wifi will work in offline mode...If the user press the IpAddress they will enter into the IpAddress Activity.Here they need to start 
the server,then provide the IpAddress and port address of their network.Then press thge button connect ..After they will be ready to send the 
messages and receive messages...The Receive message will be shown in a textview named Show Chat.They will also be able to send simple
text files to each other.The app will also provide the service to save conversation..If the user hit the save button it will save their conversation.
If the user hit the file button it will provide a option to select the file from device and send it to the receiver.
If the user hit the color button it will change the color of the sender and the receiver chat window.
